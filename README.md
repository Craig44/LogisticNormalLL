# LogisticNormalLL
A repo that looks at implementing the logistic normal negative log likelihood for composition data. I have implemented it across two platforms (other than R where it exists) so that it 
would be useful for others. The two platforms are C++ that depends on Eigen thirdparty library and TMB. To look at comparisons see the R scripts which test the functionality 
across a range of age based compositions. This work follows Francis (2014) Replacing the multinomial in stock assessment models: A first step. Fisheries Research, 151, 70-84. 
I would like to thank Chris Francis for sharing his R-code with me which is the back bone for this repo.
